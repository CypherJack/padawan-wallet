    <string name="about_text">Padawan is a signet-only bitcoin wallet packed with tutorials on how to use bitcoin wallets. We\'re building the app you will want to recommend to your friends that keep asking you questions about bitcoin!\n\nPadawan is for people of all ages and aims to be a self-study tool, getting its users acquainted with the usual workflow and basic jargon of mobile wallets in a risk-free environment perfect for experimentation and learning (signet). We think signet is an underused resource outside of software development circles, and believe it can be leveraged for bitcoin-curious people everywhere.\n\nPadawan is an open source (Apache 2.0 licenced), free collaborative project. If you have feedback for us, please leave us a review on the Play Store, or check out our GitHub repository!</string>
    <string name="send_coins_back">Signet coins can be hard to acquire, and even though they have no market value, they are not infinite, and we should be careful not to waste them or let them get lost!\n\nOnce you are done with your signet coins, please consider sending them back to the Padawan project so that we can continue sending coins to new users. Use the address above to send your coins back to us.</string>
    <string name="privacy_text">Padawan Wallet does not collect any information on its users, and does not use Firebase Crashlytics.

    <string name="l1_title">What is the Bitcoin Signet?</string>
    <string name="l1_p1">Bitcoin networks are made up of thousands of computers across the world. These computers speak a common language and communicate directly with each other over the internet.</string>
    <string name="l1_p2">You might not know, but there are many bitcoin networks! They break into two families: the main network (there is only one of those) and the test networks (there are many of those!).</string>
    <string name="l1_h2">Mainnet</string>
    <string name="l1_p3">When people talk about "the bitcoin network", they usually mean the mainnet bitcoin network (or simply "mainnet").</string>
    <string name="l1_p4">The bitcoins on mainnet have monetary value, are used as money for transactions between people, and can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges.</string>
    <string name="l1_h3">Test Networks</string>
    <string name="l1_p5">There are a few test networks, each with their own purpose. They tend to not be as well known as the mainnet network, but are very important nonetheless! Padawan uses the Signet network for its transactions, but you might also hear of Testnet3, Testnet4, and Regtest. The bitcoins on these networks are called signet/testnet/regtest coins and look and behave just like mainnet bitcoins. But unlike mainnet bitcoins, those test coins have no monetary value.</string>
    <string name="l1_p6">Test networks are used by software developers and organizations who create real-world applications that interact with bitcoin. These developers can use test networks to make sure their software is working properly before launching on mainnet. But you don\'t need to be a software developer to use them!</string>
    <string name="l1_h4">Padawan &amp;amp; Signet</string>
    <string name="l1_p7">The signet and its coins are an invaluable resource for curious people to learn, play, and get confident with bitcoin networks before handling "real" mainnet bitcoins! Remember that test bitcoins DO NOT have monetary value.</string>
    <string name="l1_p8">Padawan will teach you the foundations of bitcoin, including making transactions and backing up wallets, all using the signet network. You cannot receive or send mainnet bitcoins to or from your Padawan wallet. Any coins you have on Padawan or send to friends using the app are signet coins with NO monetary value.</string>
    <string name="l1_p9">Use Padawan to learn, practice, and test the boundaries of your bitcoin knowledge!</string>
    <string name="l2_title">Receiving bitcoin</string>
    <string name="l2_p1">To receive bitcoin, you ask your wallet software (like Padawan) to generate a receive address. Each time your receive bitcoin, a new address will be used by your wallet.</string>
    <string name="l2_p2">To make it easier to share, we display this address in two common ways:</string>
    <string name="l2_p3">1. A string of letters and numbers that might look like this:</string>
    <string name="l2_p4">Or</string>
    <string name="l2_p5">2. A QR code that might look like this:</string>
    <string name="l2_p6">The two formats above refer to the same address, just in different ways.</string>
    <string name="l2_h1">Generating receive addresses</string>
    <string name="l2_p7">To receive bitcoin, you have two options:</string>
    <string name="l2_p8">1. The sender scans a QR code: If the person who wants to send you coins is nearby, generate a new receive address and ask them to use their phone to scan the QR code displayed by your wallet.</string>
    <string name="l2_p9">2. Copy and paste the receive address to share it: Generate a new receive address, copy the string of letters and numbers (the address), and paste it in a message to the person who will send you the payment. If possible, you should try to send these messages on an encrypted platform so as to keep the address and the transaction private between you and the payer!</string>
    <string name="l2_p10">On Padawan, you can long press the address and the wallet will offer you to put the address directly into your clipboard for pasting somewhere else.</string>
    <string name="l2_h2">Be careful!</string>
    <string name="l2_p11">It is very important to be careful when sending and receiving bitcoin. The person sending bitcoin must use the exact correct address.</string>
    <string name="l2_p12">Even though the QR code system and the copy/paste function of our phones are an acceptable way of remaining cautious, you should always double check the complete receive address. At the very least, when you copy and paste your receive address, make sure the first and last 5–10 characters of the address match.</string>
    <string name="l2_p13">Reminder: Padawan only uses signet bitcoins. Do not try to send it real bitcoins!</string>
