about_text:               "Padawan is a signet-only bitcoin wallet packed with tutorials on how to use bitcoin wallets. We're building the app you will want to recommend to your friends that keep asking you questions about bitcoin!\n\nPadawan is for people of all ages and aims to be a self-study tool, getting its users acquainted with the usual workflow and basic jargon of mobile wallets in a risk-free environment perfect for experimentation and learning (signet). We think signet is an underused resource outside of software development circles, and believe it can be leveraged for bitcoin-curious people everywhere.\n\nPadawan is an open source (Apache 2.0 licenced), free collaborative project. If you have feedback for us, please leave us a review on the Play Store, or check out our GitHub repository!"
send_coins_back:          "Signet coins can be hard to acquire, and even though they have no market value, they are not infinite, and we should be careful not to waste them or let them get lost!\n\nOnce you are done with your signet coins, please consider sending them back to the Padawan project so that we can continue sending coins to new users. Use the address above to send your coins back to us."
