# Lesson 1
l1_title:                  "What is the Bitcoin Signet?"
l1_p1:                     "Bitcoin networks are made up of thousands of computers across the world. These computers speak a common language and communicate directly with each other over the internet."
l1_p2:                     "You might not know, but there are many bitcoin networks! They break into two families: the main network (there is only one of those) and the test networks (there are many of those!)."
l1_h2:                     "Mainnet"
l1_p3:                     "When people talk about \"the bitcoin network\", they usually mean the mainnet bitcoin network (or simply \"mainnet\")."
l1_p4:                     "The bitcoins on mainnet have monetary value, are used as money for transactions between people, and can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges."
l1_h3:                     "Test Networks"
l1_p5:                     "There are a few test networks, each with their own purpose. They tend to not be as well known as the mainnet network, but are very important nonetheless! Padawan uses the Signet network for its transactions, but you might also hear of Testnet3, Testnet4, and Regtest. The bitcoins on these networks are called signet/testnet/regtest coins and look and behave just like mainnet bitcoins. But unlike mainnet bitcoins, those test coins have no monetary value."
l1_p6:                     "Test networks are used by software developers and organizations who create real-world applications that interact with bitcoin. These developers can use test networks to make sure their software is working properly before launching on mainnet. But you don't need to be a software developer to use them!"
l1_h4:                     "Padawan &amp; Signet"
l1_p7:                     "The signet and its coins are an invaluable resource for curious people to learn, play, and get confident with bitcoin networks before handling \"real\" mainnet bitcoins! Remember that test bitcoins DO NOT have monetary value."
l1_p8:                     "Padawan will teach you the foundations of bitcoin, including making transactions and backing up wallets, all using the signet network. You cannot receive or send mainnet bitcoins to or from your Padawan wallet. Any coins you have on Padawan or send to friends using the app are signet coins with NO monetary value."
l1_p9:                     "Use Padawan to learn, practice, and test the boundaries of your bitcoin knowledge!"

# Lesson 2
l2_title:                  "Receiving bitcoin"
l2_p1:                     "To receive bitcoin, you ask your wallet software (like Padawan) to generate a receive address. Each time your receive bitcoin, a new address will be used by your wallet."
l2_p2:                     "To make it easier to share, we display this address in two common ways:"
l2_p3:                     "1. A string of letters and numbers that might look like this:"
l2_p4:                     "Or"
l2_p5:                     "2. A QR code that might look like this:"
l2_p6:                     "The two formats above refer to the same address, just in different ways."
l2_h1:                     "Generating receive addresses"
l2_p7:                     "To receive bitcoin, you have two options:"
l2_p8:                     "1. The sender scans a QR code: If the person who wants to send you coins is nearby, generate a new receive address and ask them to use their phone to scan the QR code displayed by your wallet."
l2_p9:                     "2. Copy and paste the receive address to share it: Generate a new receive address, copy the string of letters and numbers (the address), and paste it in a message to the person who will send you the payment. If possible, you should try to send these messages on an encrypted platform so as to keep the address and the transaction private between you and the payer!"
l2_p10:                    "On Padawan, you can long press the address and the wallet will offer you to put the address directly into your clipboard for pasting somewhere else."
l2_h2:                     "Be careful!"
l2_p11:                    "It is very important to be careful when sending and receiving bitcoin. The person sending bitcoin must use the exact correct address."
l2_p12:                    "Even though the QR code system and the copy/paste function of our phones are an acceptable way of remaining cautious, you should always double check the complete receive address. At the very least, when you copy and paste your receive address, make sure the first and last 5–10 characters of the address match."
l2_p13:                    "Reminder: Padawan only uses signet bitcoins. Do not try to send it real bitcoins!"
